# NA_NMT

## Abstract 
Non-Autoregressive models are widely used in the field of Neural Machine Translation. 
We employ three different NA transformer CMLM models with the use of two variations of Reward Based loss functions and we compare our results with
an implemented NA baseline model with Cross Entropy loss.
In addition we set side by side our BLEU and ChrF scores with an AR baseline model and other similar NA MRT models from the literature.
